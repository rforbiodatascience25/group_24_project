# Main Quarto Document

embeding guide: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html>

### Load Libraries

The package **quarto** might be needed.

To run a document use the command: `quarto_serve("document.qmd")`.

## Load Data

We call on the script: 01_load.qmd to load the data: `bone-marrow.ariff` from the: *Bone Marrow Transplant: Children* dataset.

{{< include _01_load.qmd >}}

This creates a directive `"data/_raw"`, if it didn't already exist, and downloads the data into it.

## Clean Data

The data comes an .ariff file, which simplified can be described as a file containing both metadata and a csv file.

This need to be seperated and this is done by `02_clean.qmd`, where the cleaned data is saved within `"data/"`.

{{< include _02_clean.qmd >}}
