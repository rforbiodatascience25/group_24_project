# Relapse & Second Transplant vs. Survival of Patients

Dataset: *Bone Marrow Transplantation: Children*

We want to look at the relationship between relapse and secondary transplants in patients and how it affects their odds of survival.

To do this, we look at how many relapsed, needed a second transplant, and how many of them survived and when they where observed. This is done using X variables taken from the cleaned augmented dataset, described in table 1, and then performing an analysis of the relationship between them.

| Variable | Description | Value |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----:|

| `Txpostrelapse` \| Second Bone Marrow transplantation after relapse \| Yes, No \|
| `Relapse` \| Reoccurance of disease \| Yes, No \|
| `survival_time` \| Time of Observation (Alive) or time of event in days (Dead) \| Yes, No \|
| `survival_status` \| Survival status \| Yes, No \|
| `Diseasegroup` \| Type of disease \| Malignant, Nonmalignant \|

: Table 1: The data used for this analysis is from `03_dat_aug` using these variables:`Txpostrelapse`, `Relapse`, `survival_time`, `survival_status` & `Diseasegroup`.

## Data Wrangling

### Initiate Libraries

We start by loading the relevant libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#library("table1")

```

We then load a subset of the cleaned and augmented data frame as a tibble.

```{r}

bm_data <- read_tsv(file = "data/03_dat_aug.tsv",
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

```

It contains 186 values and follows the guidelines for tidy data, with:

-   Each variable having its own column.

-   Each observation having its own row.

-   Each value having its own cell.

And all values used in this analysis does not contain missing values, see table 1 for variables.

The full tibble can be seen here.

```{r}
bm_data
```

## Data Analysis

We start by generating the subset for the first part of the analysis `relapse_surv_data` containing 4 variables.

```{r}
relapse_surv_data <- bm_data |>
  select(Txpostrelapse,
         Relapse,
         survival_status,
         survival_time)

relapse_surv_data
```

### Survival

We want to look at the relationship between survival of patients and the time of observation or event. This is done by visualizing `survival_time` and `survival_status` from subset: `relapse_surv_data`.

```{r}
#| label: Boxplot of time of survival stradified by survival status

relapse_surv_data |>
  ggplot(data = _,
         mapping = aes(x = survival_status,
                       y = survival_time,
                       fill = survival_status)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Survival Status",
       y = "Survival Time [days]",
       title = "Time differences in days between good and bad outcomes for Patients",
       subtitle = "Time stamps are either Observations for living Patients and Events for dead Patients",
       caption = "Data from the Bone Marrow Transplantation: Children dataset") +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Avenir", 
                base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "Bottom")
  
```

We can see that Patients with bad outcomes die within ADD STATISTICS days and observations taken from patients with good outcomes usually happen around ADD STATISTICS day. This says something about the observation time needed to see if an rejection of the transplantation happens.

### Relapse in Relation to Survival

Next we will look at the rate of relapses and how it relates to survival status of patients.

```{r}

relapse_surv_data |>
  count(survival_status,Relapse) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Relapse,
                       y = n,
                       fill = survival_status)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(
    preserve = "single"),
    colour = "black",
    alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())
  
```

We see a large number of the patents that survived did not relapse. This is shown in numbers below.

```{r}
relapse_surv_data |>
  count(Relapse,survival_status)
```

We see that the majority of relapsed patients did not survive. This is something we will look more into by looking who got a second transplant. INSERT STASTISTICS IN THIS SECTION!

### Secondary transplant after relapse in relation to survival

First we look at who got a second transplant. NEED BETTER TABLE!

```{r}
relapse_surv_data |>
  group_by(Txpostrelapse) |>
  count(Relapse,survival_status)
```

We then create a new subset with a new variable: `tx_history`, based on: `Txpostrelapse` & `Relapse`.

```{r}
transplant_surv_data <- relapse_surv_data |>
  mutate(
    tx_history = case_when(
      Txpostrelapse == "Yes" & Relapse == "Yes" ~  "2nd Transplant & Relapse",
      Txpostrelapse == "Yes" & Relapse == "No" ~  "2nd Transplant & no Relapse*",
      Txpostrelapse == "No" & Relapse == "Yes" ~  "No Transplant & Relapse",
      Txpostrelapse == "No" & Relapse == "No" ~  "No Transplant & no Relapse"))
  
```

Visualization of 2nd Transplant and relapse data.

```{r}

transplant_surv_data |>
  count(tx_history,survival_status) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tx_history,
                       y = n,
                       fill = factor(survival_status))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(
    preserve = "single"),
    colour = "black",
    alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  labs(caption = "*No Relapse means no remission before 2nd transplant",
       fill = "Survival Status",
       x = "Transplant and relapse History") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10,
                                   hjust = 0.5,
                                   vjust = 1))
```

We see a difference in the number of surviving patients when we look at the number of patients receiving a second transplantation, with few surviving after having a relapse.

Patients, who need a second transplantation INSERT STASTISTICS and still have not gone into remission (no relapse) have WRITE OUTCOME (A 50/50-ISH FOR MOW) chance of survival.

Patients with relapse have INSERT STATISTICS OF BOTH of surviving.

Patients, who does not need a second transplant have a better outcome with INSERT STASTITICS surviving.

**Outcome:** 2nd transplant seem to help some after relapse, but odds are grim in case of relapse.

*Somehow some are getting a transplant without haveing a relapse, either by getting a second transplantation before disease is fully gone... None survived having a second transplant after reoccurance of disease, only survived getting it before having relapse...*

### Look at 'Diseasegroup' in relation to relapse and survival

`Diseasegroup` describes if the type of disease is Malignant (1) or Nonmalignant (0)

We create a new subset with `Diseasegroup`. *2nd transplant is kept in for now, might remove later.*

```{r}
malign_surv_data <- bm_data |>
  select(Txpostrelapse,
         Relapse,
         Diseasegroup,
         survival_status,
         survival_time)
```

Then we add a variable `type_history`, which describes the type of disease the patient had.

```{r}
malign_surv_data <- malign_surv_data |>
  mutate(
    type_history = case_when(
      Diseasegroup == "Malignant" & Relapse == "Yes" ~  "Malignant & Relapse",
      Diseasegroup == "Malignant" & Relapse == "No" ~  "Malignant & no Relapse*",
      Diseasegroup == "Nonmalignant" & Relapse == "Yes" ~  "Nonmalignant & Relapse",
      Diseasegroup == "Nonmalignant" & Relapse == "No" ~  "Nonmalignant & no Relapse"))

```

Next we see if it affects relapse and survival.

```{r}
malign_surv_data |>
  count(type_history,survival_status) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = type_history,
                       y = n,
                       fill = factor(survival_status))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(
    preserve = "single"),
    colour = "black",
    alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  labs(caption = "*No Relapse means no remission",
       fill = "Survival Status",
       x = "Disease type and relapse status for Patients") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10,
                                   hjust = 0.5,
                                   vjust = 1))
```
