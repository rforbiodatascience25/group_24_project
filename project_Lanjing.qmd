## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
inmuno_data <- read_tsv('data/bone-marrow-clean.tsv')
data|> view()
```

Which gender survived the most?

```{r}
filter_gender_survival <- inmuno_data |>
  mutate(
    Recipientgender = recode(Recipientgender,
                             `0` = "Female",
                             `1` = "Male")
  ) |>
  filter(survival_status == 0) |>
  group_by(Recipientgender) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(filter_gender_survival,
       aes(x = Recipientgender, y = count, fill = Recipientgender)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Survivors by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Number of Survivors"
  )


```
