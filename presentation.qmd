## Description of the data

Table 1. Information on the subjects included in the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
Descriptive_table <- read.table("Descriptive_table_present.txt", sep = ",", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
kable(Descriptive_table, row.names = TRUE, format = "html", align = "r")
```

<br>

-   ALL, AML, chronic and non-malignant: large patient cohort

-   Lymphoma patients: small patient cohort (careful interpretation needed)

-   A majority was male among all diseases

-   Median recipient age did not vary greatly among diseases, but included both pre-adolescent and adolescent ages

-   A minority (\<18 %) experienced relapse, except in the lymphoma group (almost half)

-   A majority survived, except for lymphoma patients

-   Median follow-up time for surviving patients were around 3.5 to 6 years depending on the disease

-   Median survival time for deceased patients varied from around 2 (lymphoma) to around 9 (AML) months

## Slide 5

<br>

-   No clear connection between time for neutrophil or platelet recovery and survival time
-   Interpretation should be aware of few data points and influence of outliers
