# Presentation

```{r}

```

The order of the content is not final and will probably change.

*Cursive text* should not be shown in finished presentation!

**Final Output**

-   10 slides

## Slide 1

*Title:*

Analysis of Biological Factors affecting pediatric Patients subjected to Unmanipulated Allogeneic unrelated donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

*Aim:*

Which biological factors affect patent outcome and how can we ensure a good response?

*group names:*

Group 24: Christian, Helena, Lanjing, Inma and Pernille

## Slide 2 - Why did we use R?

*Topic:*

A bone marrow transplant is the replacement of damaged blood cells for healthy stems cells.

*Methodology:*

R programming language is a powerful tool that allowed us to clean, visualize, organize, and manipulate the data. Therefore, we were able to understand the correlation of the different varibales affecting to the survival rate after the transplant.

## Data Wrangling

**Dataset:** Bone marrow transplant: Children (Donated 20/04/2020)

**File:** bone-marrow.ariff

An Attribute-Relation File format, .ariff, has two destinct sections: Header & Data, and comments use "%".

+------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Header                 | Data                          |
+:=======================+:==============================+
| -   Contains Metadata  | -   Contains Data information |
|                        |                               |
| -   Name of Relation   | -   comma seperated entries   |

| -   List of Attributes |                               |
+------------------------+-------------------------------+

**Steps:**

1.  Download file into newly created data folders
2.  Extract metadata & data into two files: a .txt and a .tsv containing tidy data: *metadata.txt.gz & data.tsv.gz*
3.  Augment columns & binary values

## Description of the data

Table 1. Information on the subjects included in the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
Descriptive_table <- read.table("Descriptive_table_present.txt", sep = ",", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
kable(Descriptive_table, row.names = TRUE, format = "html", align = "r")
```

<br>

-   ALL, AML, chronic and non-malignant: large patient cohort

-   Lymphoma patients: small patient cohort (careful interpretation needed)

-   A majority was male among all diseases

-   Median recipient age did not vary greatly among diseases, but included both pre-adolescent and adolescent ages

-   A minority (\<18 %) experienced relapse, except in the lymphoma group (almost half)

-   A majority survived, except for lymphoma patients

-   Median follow-up time for surviving patients were around 3.5 to 6 years depending on the disease

-   Median survival time for deceased patients varied from around 2 (lymphoma) to around 9 (AML) months

## Slide 5

**Include:** (Exploratory Analysis)

## Slide 6

**Include:**

### Recipientage, Disease type, Rbodymass index VS Survival rate

The boxplot plot compares the age distribution of the recipients among the different diseases types, while dividing them by their survival status: alive and dead.

**Relevant outcomes:**

-   Patients with lymphoma had a survial rate of 0%.

-   Age might be associated with mortality, since older patients have higher mortality than young ones.

-   Every disease type exhibited higher mortality than survival.

The bar plot reveals the relationship between the BMI with survival rate. It showed that survival decreases while BMI increases. Underweight patients had the highest amount of survivors, meanwhile, the obese group was the only category which mortality exceeded survival.

<br>

-   No clear connection between time for neutrophil or platelet recovery and survival time
-   Interpretation should be aware of few data points and influence of outliers

## Slide 9

**Include:**

-   Discussion

## Slide 10

**Include:**

-   Conclusion

-   perspectivation?
